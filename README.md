• Created a model using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify user knowledge levels into 4 categories: very low, low, middle, and high while achieving a high accuracy rate of 96%.

• Identified potential attributes to be used as predictors for the classification model.

• Visualized the data to observe the distribution between each attribute and user knowledge levels, gaining insights into the relationships and patterns.

• Determined the best attribute combination to maximize the accuracy of the classifier model.

• Performed comprehensive data analysis by preprocessing the data, creating a recipe and model specification, standardizing the data, and employing cross-validation techniques to create a reproducible workflow for model fitting.

• Utilized accuracy visualization to choose the K value (number of nearest neighbors) with the highest accuracy, ensuring optimal model performance.

• Rebuilt the model specification and workflow using the selected K value and applied it to the testing data to obtain the exact accuracy of the model.

• Analyzed the results of the model and identified potential implications and benefits for future research in user knowledge classification.
